# PrNet: Bluetooth Low Energy Proximity Network
The Social Computing group has developed a data collection apparatus called PrNet (Peer Network). This sensor is a substrate for Bluetooth low energy signal strength data collection. The device enables measurement and collection of the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of data received from other Bluetooth enabled devices. Using the Arduino electronic prototyping platform, sensors are programmed for data collection and analysis. This repository contains the sensor firmware, hardware prototypes, visualizations, data analysis scripts, and raw data.
