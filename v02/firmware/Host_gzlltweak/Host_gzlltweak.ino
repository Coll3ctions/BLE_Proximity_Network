/*
This sketch demonstrates how to coordinate data
between 3 devices in a Gazell network.

The host collects RSSI samples from the Devices,
and determines which device has the strongest
average RSSI (ie: the Device that is closest
to the Host).  The Green led is set on the
closest Device.

Since the Device must initiate communication, the
device "polls" the Host evey 200ms.
